# EveryBodyCodes

Struture 4 layers:
  - controllers - api entry layer
  - business - logic business rules  
  - Cross layer - to share between layers common models, entities, extensions, and helpers
  - External Services - should be used to connecto with services

Comments:  
 - Implemented Prime Number Action Filter, inside controllers layers PrimeNumberActionFilter.cs
 - Simple custom sort, can be configured inside appsettings.json, key "NumbersOrder" :  "desc"
 
 - I've added swagger ui, so literally run the solution and go for it.
